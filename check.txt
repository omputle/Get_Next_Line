You don't come around, to me see in the week
You don't have a chance, to call me on the phone
You don't come around, to me see in the week
You don't have a chance, to call me on the phone
But Friday night yes I know, yes I know
I know I must be ready for you, just be waiting for you
Friday night yes I know, yes I know
I know I must be ready for you, just be waiting for you
I'm no weekend, weekend special
